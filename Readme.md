yo so i am sorry for the horrible disigne and spelling of this thing but i am rly tired and stuff
but basicly
if u look in fonts.css u can see all the fonts that i have
if u want to change the font of something just go the the class tag of the thing and add the name of the font

.italiano{
    font-family: 'Italianno', cursive;
}

just copy and paste the thing after the dot and before the curly thing

add it to the class tag by just 

<p class="poemtitle">"Gramercy, Adieu"</p>
like for example to add italiano it will look like this
<p class="poemtitle italiano">"Gramercy, Adieu"</p>
yea so if u have any other questions
eaither search it up
or i might be awake

sorry agin for the bad design
